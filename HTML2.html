             <p> Bangladesh is an independent and sovereign country in South Asia, with its capital in Dhaka. </p>
             It gained independence from Pakistan through the Liberation War of 1971.
             Bangladesh is bordered by Myanmar to the east, India to the west and north,
             and the Bay of Bengal to the south. The official language is Bengali,
             and the currency is Taka. Though it is primarily an agricultural country,
             it has seen significant progress in industry, information technology, and exports.
             The world's longest sea beach, Cox Bazar, and the largest mangrove forest,
             the Sundarbans, are located in Bangladesh. The people of Bangladesh are hospitable,
             cultured, and resilient.
