#  HTML Practice

This repository contains the HTML files I created while learning web development.  
I started learning HTML in my 3rd semester as part of my journey into front-end development.


##  What’s Inside?

This repo includes basic HTML examples and practice files, covering topics like:

- HTML Boilerplate Structure (`<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`)
- Headings, Paragraphs, Line Breaks
- Text Formatting (bold, italic, underline, subscript, superscript, etc.)
- Links and Images
- Lists (ordered, unordered, nested)
- HTML Tables (basic to slightly advanced)
- HTML Comments
- Use of inline styles

 **Note:** So far, I’ve completed practice up to HTML tables. I plan to continue learning and add more topics like Forms, Semantic Elements, and eventually move on to CSS and JavaScript.


##  File Structure

Each file is named clearly so that anyone (including future me) can understand what the code demonstrates.  
Some examples:

- `headings_paragraphs.html` — Heading tags (`<h1>` to `<h6>`) and paragraph formatting  
- `text_formatting.html` — Bold, italic, underline, strikethrough, etc.  
- `links_and_images.html` — Anchor tags (`<a>`) and image tags (`<img>`)  
- `list_examples.html` — Ordered and unordered lists, nested lists  
- `tables_practice.html` — Creating tables with rows, columns, headers  
- `comments_and_spacing.html` — Using `<!-- HTML comments -->` and spacing techniques

##  How to Use

You can open any file in your browser by simply double-clicking on it, or opening it with VS Code and using the Live Server extension for better preview.


##  Why This Repository?

I created this repository to keep track of my learning and practice as I progress through HTML.  
This not only helps me revise quickly but also lets others see how I started learning the fundamentals of web design.

In future updates, I will add:

- **Forms** (input, button, radio, checkbox, etc.)  
- **Semantic Tags** (`<section>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`, etc.)  
- **Media Embedding** (video, audio, iframe)  
- **HTML5 best practices**



##  About Me

Hi! I’m **Nayem Uddin**, currently a 3rd semester student in the **Department of Computer Science and Engineering**,  
at the **University of Science and Technology Chittagong (USTC)**.

I started learning HTML recently out of interest in web development.  
This repository reflects my early progress. As I move forward, I plan to learn **CSS** and **JavaScript** next, and start building small websites and projects.

Thanks for visiting!
