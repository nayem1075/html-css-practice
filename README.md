# HTML & CSS Practice

This repository contains the **HTML and CSS files** I created while learning web development.  
I started learning HTML in my 3rd semester as part of my journey into **front-end development** and recently began practicing **CSS** to style my pages.


## What’s Inside?

This repo includes basic HTML and CSS examples, covering topics like:

**HTML Topics:**
- HTML Boilerplate Structure (`<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`)
- Headings, Paragraphs, Line Breaks
- Text Formatting (bold, italic, underline, subscript, superscript, strikethrough)
- Links and Images
- Lists (ordered, unordered, nested)
- HTML Tables (basic to slightly advanced)
- HTML Comments
- Inline styles

**CSS Topics:**
- Selectors (element, class, ID)
- Colors, Fonts, Text Styles
- Box Model (padding, margin, border)
- Backgrounds and Gradients
- Layouts (flexbox basics, positioning)
- Simple hover effects and transitions

> **Note:** So far, I’ve completed practice up to HTML tables and basic CSS styling.  
> I plan to continue learning and add more topics like Forms, Semantic Elements, Advanced CSS, and eventually move on to JavaScript.

## File Structure

Each file is named clearly so that anyone (including future me) can understand what the code demonstrates.  
Some examples:

- `headings_paragraphs.html` — Heading tags (`<h1>` to `<h6>`) and paragraph formatting  
- `text_formatting.html` — Bold, italic, underline, strikethrough, etc.  
- `links_and_images.html` — Anchor tags (`<a>`) and image tags (`<img>`)  
- `list_examples.html` — Ordered, unordered, nested lists  
- `tables_practice.html` — Creating tables with rows, columns, headers  
- `comments_and_spacing.html` — Using `<!-- HTML comments -->` and spacing techniques  
- `style_examples.css` — CSS practice for styling HTML pages

## How to Use

You can open any HTML file in your browser by **double-clicking it**, or open it in **VS Code** and use the **Live Server extension** for a better preview.  
CSS files are linked inside the HTML files, so changes to CSS will reflect automatically in the browser.

## Why This Repository?

Since I am pursuing a future in **Cybersecurity**, it’s crucial for me to have a solid understanding of how websites are **built, styled, and rendered** in browsers.  
Learning HTML & CSS helps me understand:

- Web page structure and design  
- Input fields (which are often exploited)  
- Client-side content manipulation  
- How web vulnerabilities arise  

I’ll keep updating this repository as I progress.
