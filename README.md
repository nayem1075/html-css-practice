#  HTML Practice

This repository contains the HTML files I created while learning web development.  
I started learning HTML in my 3rd semester as part of my journey into front-end development.


##  What’s Inside?

This repo includes basic HTML examples and practice files, covering topics like:

- HTML Boilerplate Structure (`<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`)
- Headings, Paragraphs, Line Breaks
- Text Formatting (bold, italic, underline, subscript, superscript, etc.)
- Links and Images
- Lists (ordered, unordered, nested)
- HTML Tables (basic to slightly advanced)
- HTML Comments
- Use of inline styles

 **Note:** So far, I’ve completed practice up to HTML tables. I plan to continue learning and add more topics like Forms, Semantic Elements, and eventually move on to CSS and JavaScript.


##  File Structure

Each file is named clearly so that anyone (including future me) can understand what the code demonstrates.  
Some examples:

- `headings_paragraphs.html` — Heading tags (`<h1>` to `<h6>`) and paragraph formatting  
- `text_formatting.html` — Bold, italic, underline, strikethrough, etc.  
- `links_and_images.html` — Anchor tags (`<a>`) and image tags (`<img>`)  
- `list_examples.html` — Ordered and unordered lists, nested lists  
- `tables_practice.html` — Creating tables with rows, columns, headers  
- `comments_and_spacing.html` — Using `<!-- HTML comments -->` and spacing techniques

##  How to Use

You can open any file in your browser by simply double-clicking on it, or opening it with VS Code and using the Live Server extension for better preview.


##  Why This Repository?

Since I am pursuing a future in **Cybersecurity**, it’s crucial for me to have a solid understanding of how websites are built and rendered in browsers.  
HTML is the foundation of all web pages, and this practice is my first step toward understanding:

- Web page structure  
- Input fields (which are often exploited)  
- Client-side content manipulation  
- How web vulnerabilities arise

I’ll keep updating this repository as I progress.


## About Me

Hi! I’m **Nayem Uddin**, currently a 3rd semester student in the **Department of Computer Science and Engineering**,  
at the **University of Science and Technology Chittagong (USTC)**.

My ultimate goal is to become a **Cybersecurity Professional**, and this repository reflects my learning journey, starting with HTML.  
I believe knowing the structure of web pages will help me understand security flaws better in the long run.

Thanks for checking out my progress. Stay safe and secure!
