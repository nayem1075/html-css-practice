           Bangladesh is our motherland. It is a small but beautiful country in South Asia. The land is full of greenery, rivers, and fertile soil. Most of the people are farmers, and agriculture is the main source of livelihood. Our language is Bangla, and we are proud of our culture and traditions. Bangladesh became independent in 1971 after a long struggle and sacrifice of millions of people. The Sundarbans, Coxâ€™s Bazar, and many historical places make our country special. Our red and green flag inspires us to love our motherland deeply. Truly, Bangladesh is our pride and glory.
